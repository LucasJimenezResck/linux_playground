I′m no superman
I can't take your hand
And fly you anywhere
You want to go (yeah)
I can′t read your mind
Like a billboard sign
And tell you everything
You want to hear, but
I'll be your hero

I, i can be everything you need
If you're the one for me
Like gravity
I′ll be unstoppable
I, yeah, i believe in destiny
I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul
But if you′re the one for me
Then i'll be your hero
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one for me?
Then i′ll be a hero
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one for me?
Then i'll be a hero

Searching high and low
Trying every road
But if i see your face
How will i know? yeah
I′ll put my trust in fate
That you will come my way
And if it's right
It′s undeniable, yeah

I'll be your hero

I, i can be everything you need
If you're the one for me
Like gravity
I′ll be unstoppable
I, yeah, i believe in destiny
I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul
But if you′re the one for me
Then i'll be your hero
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one for me?
Then i′ll be a hero
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one for me?
Then i'll be a hero

So incredible
Some kind of miracle
And when it′s meant to be
I'll become a hero
So i′ll wait, wait, wait, wait for you
Yeah, i'll be your hero

I, i can be everything you need
If you're the one for me
Like gravity
I′ll be unstoppable
I, yeah, i believe in destiny
I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul
But if you′re the one for me
Then i'll be your hero
Could you be the one?
